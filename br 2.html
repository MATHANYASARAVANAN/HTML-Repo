    <h1>storage</h1><p> Requires a continuous supply of electricity to store/retain data. It acts as a computer’s <br>primary storage for temporarily storing data and handling application workloads. Examples of non-volatile storage include cache memory and random access memory (RAM).

        <br>Non-Volatile Sto<br> isn’t supplied with electrical power. <br>This is often referred to as a secondary storage mechanism, and is used for permanent data storage requiring I/O operations. Examples of volatile storage include a hard disk, USB storage and optical media.
        
        Storage is often confused for<br>
         memory, although in computing the two terms have different meanings. Memory refers to short-term location of temporary data (see volatile storage above), while storage devices, in fact, store data on a long-term basis for later<br> uses and access. While memory is cleared every time a computer is turned off, stored data is sa<br>. <br>Secondary storage can hold and handle significantly larger sizes of data, and keeps it inactive <br>Storage devices include a broad range of different magnetic, optical, flash, and virtual drives. They can be either internal (if they’re part of the computer’s hardware), external (if they are installed outside the computer), or removable (if they can be plugged in and removed without opening the computer). Storage also includes many forms of virtual and online storage devices such <br>as cloud to allow users to access their data from multiple devices.</p>

<h1>linux and unix</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing Unix vs Linux, Linux source code is available to the general public whereas, in Unix, the source code is proprietary.
    UNIX OS was created in the late 1960s at AT&T Bell Labs whereas Linux is an operating system built by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991.
    The main difference between Linux and Unix is Linux is a clone of Unix
    When we compare Unix to Linux, Linux default shell is BASH while the Unix shell is Bourne Shell.
    One key Unix and Linux difference is that Linux threat detection and solution are very fast while Unix users require longer wait times to get the proper bug fixing patch.
    Important versions of Linux are Redhat, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Solaris, whereas important versions of Unix are HP-UX, AIS, BSD, etc</p>
